This project was a good introduction into the critical problem of data protection across network 
communiction.The short-coming in our project is that, automatically the data is not sent 
sequentially. Example: after the first student data is received by the client, 
the system pause at server side is cleared to send the second data. Then, the 
system pause at client side is cleared to receive the second data.

So future work would include sending other data across the netwrok other than a text file, and 
determining if this effects the security. There are also many other ways of encoding data that 
should be explored.
